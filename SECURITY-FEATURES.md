# Playwright MCP Security Features

This document outlines the security features and considerations for the playwright-mcp project.

## Security Features

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
   - Proper sanitization of file paths and other potentially dangerous inputs
   - Input validation present in config parsing

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Secure error handling practices
   - No sensitive information is exposed in error messages or logs

3. **Secure Architecture**:
   - Uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured communication
   - Avoids direct command execution from user inputs
   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials in the codebase

4. **Browser Security**:
   - Option to run in isolated browser contexts
   - Support for HTTPS error handling
   - Clean session management

## Best Practices for Secure Usage

1. **Always use the latest version** to ensure you have the most recent security patches.

2. **Run with minimal privileges** when possible.

3. **Configure proper timeouts** to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

4. **Validate URLs** before navigating to them to prevent navigation to malicious sites.

5. **Use proper error handling** in your implementations to catch and handle exceptions securely.
